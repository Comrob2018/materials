# Basic Input and Output in Python

This folder contains the code examples for the Real Python tutorial [Basic Input and Output in Python](https://realpython.com/python-input-output/).

You can run all of the scripts directly by specifying their name:

```sh
$ python <filename>.py
```

If you're on a Windows sytem, then you'll need to install `pyreadline3` before you can see the benefits of importing `readline`, like done in `improved_input.py`.
